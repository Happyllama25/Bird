# Bird

Simple app that takes every possible FaceID ARKit value + Pitch, Roll, Yaw, and streams it over OSC

i dont really know why i called it "bird" - i mean likely im the only one to ever use this app?

# To do
fill this section in with the actual values and keys it spits out, and/or a demo
idk ill do it eventually hopefully probably maybe
